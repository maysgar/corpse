<p>Once upon a time, in a far off land, there lived 4 small elves in a giant treehouse at the top of a hill.
One day the momma elf was out wandering through the forest near the their treehouse when a big bear jumped out from behind a bush.
The bear growled and stood on its hind legs and the momma elf scurried to grab here childern. The elves and the bear stood their for a few seconds staring at each other intently.
Finally the bear lowered its head and slowly turned around to leave. The momma elf sighed with relief and continued to trek though the dense forest surrounding the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>She then realized, the only thing that scares off a bear is a bigger bear. The four elves trembled in terror as a bear twice the size of the previous one broke through the trees. Mama elf's brain raced. She had no idea what to do from here. After a few quick seconds, she got an idea that just might save her and her kids.</p>
<p>
  She was going to run downhill, everyone knows that bears can't run downhill. With Scooby Doo like speed, they took off down the nearest slope, and before they knew it they had reached a cliff and had to jump. They aimed for the bushes, but sadly they missed. The bear then went off to hunt something else.
