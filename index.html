<p>Once upon a time, in a far off land, there lived 4 small elves in a giant treehouse at the top of a hill.
One day the momma elf was out wandering through the forest near the their treehouse when a big bear jumped out from behind a bush.
The bear growled and stood on its hind legs and the momma elf scurried to grab here childern. The elves and the bear stood their for a few seconds staring at each other intently.
Finally the bear lowered its head and slowly turned around to leave. The momma elf sighed with relief and continued to trek though the dense forest surrounding the bottom of the hill.</p>
