    <h1>A walk through the Forest</h1>
  </header>

<section>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a far off land, there lived 4 small elves in a giant treehouse at the top of a hill.
  One day the momma elf was out wandering through the forest near their treehouse when a big bear jumped out from behind a bush.
  The bear growled and stood on its hind legs and the momma elf scurried to grab here childern. The elves and the bear stood their for a few seconds staring at each other intently.
  Finally the bear lowered its head and slowly turned around to leave. The momma elf sighed with relief and continued to trek though the dense forest surrounding the bottom of the hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    She then realized, the only thing that scares off a bear is a bigger bear. The four elves trembled in terror as a bear twice the size of the
    previous one broke through the trees. Mama elf's brain raced. She had no idea what to do from here. After a few quick seconds, she got an idea
    that just might save her and her kids.
  </p>

  <p>
    She was going to run downhill, everyone knows that bears can't run downhill. With Scooby Doo like speed, they took off down the nearest slope, and
    before they knew it they had reached a cliff and had to jump. They aimed for the bushes, but sadly they missed. The bear then went off to hunt something else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily, even though they missed the bushes, they landed inside the river. So they all started swimming trying to reach the shore, which was going to be hard
    because of all the huge alligators that started surrounding them. After a few seconds, one of them was able to crawl to the nearest rock and grab a stick to
    try to scare and fight the gators for the rest of the group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Little did they know that the stick was actually a snake! But instead of bitting them, they threw the snake in the aligator's mouth and it chocked and died. The other aligators got scared and swam away.
    They swam safetly back to the shore and continued on their journey. Though the danger of the river was behind them, they began to enter deeper into the forest.
    Little did they know that the noise they made in the river had attracted the attention of ancient forest guardian.
  </p>

  <p>
    This forest was not your average forest. It was haunted over 100 years ago when a small snake was cursed by the forest guardian. This snake slithered
    across the forest floor bringing with it the curse of the forest guardian. The snake climbed trees, slithered down holes and crossed rivers. After many years the snake had spread
    the curse to the entire forest. It was always difficult to cross the forest but today was different, the snake had just given birth and the baby snakes were loose in the forest.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eggs had just hatched, and the baby snakes were quick to learn how to slither. They emerged from their nest and travelled in a swarm to find something that had yet to be 
    tainted by their mother's curse. It was quick unfortunate when they slithered up to a woodsman who had been living in th forest for a couple of weeks. Though they were dangerous, 
    the snakes were no match fr the woodsman who smote off their heads in one fell swoop of his axe. The woodsman went back to chopping wood.
  </p>
  <p>
    What a day, thought the woodsman as he chopped the wood. That is all he did all day was chop wood for his fire at night. To be honest, he was probably quite lonely, but that is what
    one gets when one lives in a cursed forest alone. Then he thought about the babies he just killed and was sad because he was not a father. Perhaps that was what he was missing in his life; 
    a little boy woodsman running around and collecting kindling for his pa. Yes, that was quite a dream. But dreams are dreams, thought the woodsman as he chopped even more wood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those old days were already gone, back when the woodsman lived a happy life with his wife. He would chop wood during the day, while his wife would take care of the vegetable plantation;
    and they would enjoy the sunset and the night together after a long day of work. They were hoping to form a family and have little children that would run and play around the cabin all day
    long. However, things did not turn out too well for them.
