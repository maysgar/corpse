Collaboratory group story for Homework 3 of ATLS 4519 Web Creative Dev Tools at University of Colorado Boulder

# Exquisite Corpse simple website
The project was done by 5 people, so one of us started a story by writing its first paragraph,
and the rest of the group followed by writing each one a paragraph at a time but with the rule of
just being able to read the paragraph above. 15 paragraphs in total.
